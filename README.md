## Setup

1. **Install uv**
	Download and install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) from the official repository or use:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv self update
uv python install 3.13
```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
```bash
uv venv
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

---

## Usage

1. Start the server:
```python
python rsa-generation.py
```
2. Double check key creation
3. Encrypt / Decrypt Messages
```python
python rsa-encryption.py
```
4. Example Usage (Encrypt / Decrypt Files):
```python
encrypt_file("{plain.txt}", "{encrypted.bin}", {public_key})
decrypt_file("{encrypted.bin}", "{decrypted.txt}", {private_key})
```

## Security Features

- Uses strong RSA encryption for data confidentiality
- Employs OAEP padding with SHA-256 for secure encryption and decryption
- Separates private and public key files to prevent unauthorized access
- Loads keys from files, supporting secure key storage practices
- Utilizes standard cryptographic libraries to avoid custom, error-prone implementations
- Supports custom key lengths for adjustable security levels
